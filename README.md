# Testing and training FOG dataset to get the best model for Object Detection and Classification With YOLOv8

## Introduction
This project is a part of the final project of the Smart India Hackathon at the Nalla Malla Engineering College. The goal of this project is to train and test the FOG dataset to get the best model for object detection and classification with YOLOv8.

## My Contribution
I have tested the yolov8 with inbuild dataset of YOLOv8. Which are yolov8n.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt, yolov8l.pt, yolov8x.pt. I have tested these models with the FOG dataset. I have also tested the yolov8 with the custom dataset which is created by me. I have also tested the yolov8 with the custom dataset which is created by me.
